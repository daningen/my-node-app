          As a project manager, one needs both administrative and technical knowledge, as well as a good understanding of the application requirements of the project. At Centido, our team members have vast experience in leading various projects in insurance system development. We also understand that in smaller projects, project managers may need to take on other roles, such as system developers. Our extensive experience in different phases of development makes us particularly suitable for such assignments.

          The role of a system architect requires in-depth knowledge and understanding of the business that the system will support. Our insurance expertise and understanding of user needs and preferences make some of us at Centido particularly well-suited as system architects. We can leverage our experience from many different development projects to find the optimal system solution and avoid mistakes that could otherwise delay and increase project costs.

          To work as a technical project manager requires broad knowledge of the different technical environments, tools, and opportunities that may arise in a project. It also requires a rich network of contacts among suppliers of both hardware and software. At Centido, our team members have many years of experience in the IT industry, and we continuously develop our knowledge in line with the company's policy. Our knowledge of, for example, "ready-made" software products specially developed for the insurance industry, can save time and money in development work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, specialized knowledge at a deep, detailed level is necessary, and that's where Centido's expertise comes in. For example, in document management and output systems, two critical components in insurance systems. We're happy to assist your own system developers with our specialist knowledge whenever required.

          A scrum master's role is to ensure that the team is fully functional and productive, eliminate obstacles, ensure that scrum values and principles are followed, and promote communication within the team, with the product owner, and the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several of Centido's team members have extensive experience working with agile software development, scrum, and hold SCM certification from Agile Alliance.
